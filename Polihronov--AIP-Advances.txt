\begin{abstract}
This article examines the Bouton-Lie group invariants of the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) for incompressible fluids. The theory is applied to the general scaling transformation admitted by the NSE: it adds new PDEs to the Navier-Stokes system of equations and is used to derive all self-similar solutions. This method can be applied to any differential equation exhibiting scaling invariance. The solutions are found to be isobaric polynomials which can be smooth and nonzero at the initial moment. The non self-similar velocity and pressure fields in the case of constant viscosity at all scales are studied and also found to be polynomials, nonzero and smooth at the initial moment; they vanish far away from the origin and are not increasing in time. For a subset of the solutions, the cavitation number is shown to be a conserved quantity; the invariant analysis is extended to higher-dimensioned manifolds for the purpose of finding additional conserved quantities.

\section{Introduction}
This article presents a study of the symmetry properties of the NSE by following a similar work on the general linear differential equation (GLDE, given below) by C. L. Bouton \cite{Bou99}. The invariants of the NSE are examined with the purpose to draw conclusions about the solutions and their properties. 
The NSE is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
	\rho \left( \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + (\vec{u} \cdot \nabla)\vec{u} \right) &=& \mu \Delta \vec{u} - \nabla p \nonumber\\
	\nabla \cdot \vec{u} &=& 0 \nonumber\\
	\label{NSE}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\vec{u}(x,y,z,t)=(u,v,w)$ and $\rho=\mbox{const}$.
This article is organized as follows: First, we apply Bouton's invariant analysis to the NSE; it is based on the theory of point transformations and Lie groups which is a well-known tool for the study of both ODEs and PDEs \cite{Coh11}. 
Bouton’s contribution is in showing how to apply Lie’s theory of continuous groups to the scaling transformation of any invariant function. His analysis concerns the invariant functions only, and their behavior under a finite transformation. The analysis is not affected by the type of differential equation, and can be applied to any DE which exhibits scaling invariance. This generality of Bouton’s invariant theory affirms it as a robust method for the study of differential equations.


In our analysis of the NSE, we use the most general scaling transformation, as published by Ercan-Kavvas \cite{Erc15}, wherein the viscosity $\nu$ is allowed to scale-transform. Self-similar solutions are derived by applying Bouton's first theorem. Next, we re-examine NSE criticality based on the derived solutions. We show that under the general scaling transformation, the energy of the standard NSE system is no longer supercritical and can be critical or subcritical. Criticality criteria are derived and shown to be governed by a 5/2 law. Using the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion \cite{BKM}, we then argue that the solutions are not affected by rescaling when the NSE problem is energy-subcritical.

As a next step, we examine the scaling transformation where the viscosity $\nu$ is not allowed to transform but is kept fixed at all length scales. The solutions of the preceding paragraph are non self-similar in this case; the ones that remain self-similar are those of Leray \cite{{Erc15},{Brad18}}. We show that for a subset of Leray's solutions we can derive a scale-invariant, conserved quantity, namely Euler's or, cavitation number of the fluid. The non self-similar solutions are found to be polynomials of $x,y,z,t$. In the last sections, we employ Cartan's calculus in order to show that Bouton's first theorem is but the first of nine steps in the differential geometry analysis of the NSE. In each stage, the Lie derivatives of differential forms are set to zero along the flows of the infinitesimal operators admitted by the NSE and are solved as a system, which yields their common invariants; some of them are shown to be conserved quantities. Seven such conserved quantities are found; they are differential forms on manifolds, associated with the flow of liquids. Their role as conditions on the pressure and velocity of the fluid in turbulent flows is discussed.

\section{Relative Scale Invariance and Isobarity}
The GLDE $y^{(n)}+na_1 y^{(n-1)}+...+a_ny=0$, where $a_s$ and $y$ are functions of $x$ was studied by Bouton \cite{Bou99} for the case of the two scaling transformations $x^{\prime} = x; y^{\prime} = Cy$ and $x^{\prime} = Cx; y^{\prime} = y$ (primes denote transformation) since they leave the GLDE unchanged. Bouton's first theorem describes the functional form of all invariants: they are homogeneous and isobaric polynomials or the ratio of such polynomials. Isobarity of a polynomial indicates that all its terms have the same isobaric weight, where the weight is defined in \ref{weights}). 

Application of the aforementioned theorem to the NSE begins with the time translations, scale changes and rotations (details provided in later chapters) admitted by the NSE \cite{Llo81}, the scaling transformation being
\begin{eqnarray}	
	(x',y',z')&=&k(x,y,z) \nonumber \\
	t'&=&k^2 t \nonumber \\
	(u',v',w')&=&(1/k)(u,v,w) \nonumber \\
	p'&=&(1/k^2)p,  \nonumber \\
	0<k<\infty,& &k=\mbox{const}. 
\label{scaling}
\end{eqnarray}
We omit the admitted groups that are not Lie groups. The NSE does not admit any other groups \cite{Llo81}. The general scaling transformation admitted by the Navier-Stokes equation is \cite{Erc15}:

\begin{eqnarray}	
	(x',y',z')&=&k^{\alpha_x}(x,y,z) \nonumber \\ 
	t'&=&k^{\alpha_t} t \nonumber \\
	\rho^{\prime} &=& k^{\alpha_\rho} \rho  \nonumber \\
	(u',v',w')&=&k^{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}(u,v,w) \nonumber\\
	p'&=&k^{\alpha_\rho+2\alpha_x-2\alpha_t}p  \nonumber \\
	\nu^{\prime} &=& k^{2\alpha_x-\alpha_t} \nu  \nonumber \\
	g_i' &=& k^{\alpha_x-2\alpha_t} g_i, i=1,2,3  \nonumber \\
	0< k< \infty,& & k=\mbox{const} 
      	\label{EK-scaling}
\end{eqnarray}
and if $\alpha_t=2, \alpha_x=1$ with gravitational acceleration $g_i=0$, we arrive at the scaling transformation (\ref{scaling}). In the general case (\ref{EK-scaling}), all three spatial variables transform with the same scaling exponent $\alpha_x$ and all three velocity components transform with the same scaling exponent $\alpha_x-\alpha_t$; $\alpha_x$ and $\alpha_t$ are arbitrary real numbers. 

In this work, we set $g_i=0$. Also, we set ``$p$" to stand for $p/\rho$ and thus the finite transformation for $p$ in (\ref{EK-scaling}) will become $p'=k^{2\alpha_x-2\alpha_t}p$. If the NSE is dimensionalized, $\nu$ must scale-transform since it is a dimensional constant ($\nu$ has dimension) and may be thought of $\nu=x_0^2/t_0$. In the nondimensionalized NSE the coefficient $\nu$ no longer denotes viscosity, but the reciprocal value of the Reynolds number $\mbox{Re}^{-1}$; if Re is not allowed to scale, (\ref{EK-scaling}) still applies as long as $\alpha_t=2\alpha_x$. However, as we will see later, Leray's self-similar solutions are the solutions of the nondimensionalized NSE and their self-similarity is due to scaling invariance; obviously all variables in the nondimensionalized NSE are unitless and yet allowed to scale. We will therefore examine in more detail both cases for the viscosity $\nu$: (1) $\nu$ is allowed to scale; (2) $\nu$ is kept fixed at all length scales. Introduce the following definitions: \cite{Bou99}

\begin{definition}
	An {\it absolute invariant/covariant} $I$ of the NSE is a function of the independent variables $x,y,z,t$. Upon transformations (\ref{scaling})-(\ref{EK-scaling}) it remains unchanged, $I' = I$. Invariants do not contain the dependent variables $u,v,w,p$ or their derivatives; covariants do.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	A {\it relative invariant/covariant} $R$ of the NSE is a function of the independent variables $x,y,z,t$, which transforms according to the rule $R'=f R$  upon transformation (\ref{scaling})-(\ref{EK-scaling}); $f$ is the transformation factor. Invariants do not contain the dependent variables $u,v,w,p$ or their derivatives; covariants do.
\label{rel-cov}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Define isobaric weights as follows: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
	W(x^a)=W(y^a)=W(z^a)&=&a\alpha_x \nonumber \\
	W(t^b)&=&b\alpha_t \nonumber\\
	W(u^a) = W(v^a)=W(w^a)&=&(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)a \nonumber \\ 
	W(p^b)&=&2(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)b \nonumber\\
	W(\nu^c)&=&(2\alpha_x-\alpha_t)c.
\end{eqnarray*}
When variables are multiplied, their weights are added. For example, the polynomial $x^2+y^2+z^2+t^3$ is isobaric for $\alpha_x=1$, $\alpha_t=2/3$.  
\label{weights}
\end{definition}

Bouton uses the term {\it absolute invariant} $I$, commonly known as {\it invariant}, to distinguish it from the {\it relative invariant} $R$. The latter type of invariant is less common, however it is central in Bouton’s invariant theory and through this relative invariant one is able to analyze the self-similar solutions of the NSE.

Under the finite scaling transformation (\ref{scaling}) the relative invariants and covariants $R$ of the NSE must transform according to the law $R'=fR$. Then, here $f=k^q$. If $\alpha_t=2,\alpha_x=1$ the relative covariants $R=u$, $R=v$ and $R=w$ yield $f=k^{-1}$, while the relative covariant $R=p$ yields $f=k^{-2}$. Under the general scaling transformation (\ref{EK-scaling}), the factor of the relative invariants/covariants of the NSE is $f=k^{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}$ for the velocity and $f=k^{2(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)}$ for the pressure. Under a finite transformation the dependent variables (the jet-space variables, or relative covariants) $u$, $v$, $w$ and $p$ transform the same way as the relative invariant functions $u(x,y,z,t)$, $v(x,y,z,t)$, $w(x,y,z,t)$ and $p(x,y,z,t)$. To ensure that their factor $f$ is correct upon scaling transformation, they must be isobaric polynomials of their respective weight in the $x,y,z$ and also in $t$; or, they may be a ratio of such polynomials. These are the only functions arising in the study of the scaling invariants of the NSE, analogously with the invariants of the GLDE \cite{Bou99}. All presented reasoning in this section therefore sums up in the following theorem, analogously with Bouton's theorem on the GLDE \cite{Bou99}:

\begin{thm}
	(of Bouton): To meet all isobarity requirements of their scaling transformation, the relative invariant functions $u(x,y,z,t)$, $v(x,y,z,t)$ and $w(x,y,z,t)$ must be isobaric in $x,y,z$ and $t$ of weight $W=\alpha_x-\alpha_t$; while the relative invariant function $p(x,y,z,t)$  must be isobaric in $x,y,z$ and $t$ of weight $W=2(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)$. The Navier-Stokes system of PDEs becomes: 
\begin{eqnarray}
	\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + (\vec{u} \cdot \nabla)\vec{u} &=& \nu \Delta \vec{u} - \nabla p \nonumber\\
	\nabla \cdot \vec{u} &=& 0 \nonumber\\
	(\vec{r}\cdot\nabla)\vec{u}+t\frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_x}\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t}&=&\frac{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}{\alpha_x}\vec{u} \nonumber\\
	(\vec{r}\cdot\nabla)p+t\frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_x}\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}&=&\frac{2(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)}{\alpha_x} p.
	\label{NSE1}	
\end{eqnarray}
\label{T2-Bouton}
\end{thm}
Here, $\vec{r}=(x,y,z)$ is the position vector. The added equations represent isobarity conditions. 

\section{When Viscosity is allowed to scale}
To find the self-similar solutions of the NSE we apply Theorem \ref{T2-Bouton}; with the aid of the symbolic package Maple \cite{Map19}, the added equations can be integrated to yield:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\vec{u}& =& t^{\frac{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}{\alpha_t}} \mathbf{F} \left( \frac{x}{t^{\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_t}}},\frac{y}{t^{\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_t}}} ,\frac{z}{t^{\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_t}}}  \right)  \nonumber \\
	p &=& t^{\frac{2(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)}{\alpha_t}} F \left( \frac{x}{t^{\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_t}}},\frac{y}{t^{\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_t}}} ,\frac{z}{t^{\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_t}}}  \right).
	\label{gen-selfsimilarsol}
\end{eqnarray}
These expressions are the self-similar solutions of the PDE system (\ref{NSE1}); they are isobaric polynomials fields (or the ratio of such polynomials) due to the scaling invariance of the NSE. The general form (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol}) is a necessary condition that all self-similar solutions must meet. 

To ensure meaningful physics of the fluid at $t=0$ and throughout $\rm I\!R^3$, we formulate the following lemma for the velocity and pressure fields (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol}):

\begin{lem}
Bouton's self-similar solutions (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol}) can be nonzero and smooth at $t=0$ if and only if they are in the form
\begin{eqnarray}
	\vec{u} &=&\mathbf{C} t^{\frac{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}{\alpha_t}} +  x^{\frac{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}{\alpha_x}} \mathbf{P} \left( \frac{y}{x},\frac{z}{x}  \right)  \nonumber \\
	p &=& C t^{\frac{2(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)}{\alpha_t}} +   x^{\frac{2(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)}{\alpha_x}} P \left( \frac{y}{x},\frac{z}{x}  \right) ,
	\label{gen-selfsimilarsol1}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathbf{C}$ and $C$ are constants and the remaining terms are isobaric polynomials.
\label{Lemma}
\end{lem}

%\begin{proof}
% INSERT PROOF here
	The self-similar solutions are in the form (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol}). Based on the symmetry properties of the NSE, we will assume that isobaric solutions (i.e. those that scale-transform according to (\ref{EK-scaling})) always exist.  We can also add the assumption, that our chosen solution is smooth at $t=0$ in order to guarantee meaningful value of the initial energy. Smoothness of (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol}) at $t=0$ requires $(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)/\alpha_t >0$ and  $(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)/\alpha_x >0$, that is, smoothness of the arbitrary functions $\mathbf{F}$ and $F$ everywhere in $\rm I\!R^3$ and for $t=0$. If $t$ is a factor in (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol}) however, even though smooth, such solution is trivial as it is identically zero when $t=0$; and since there is no forcing term in the NSE,  eq.(\ref{NSE}), the fluid system would be left with a total energy of zero, because its sole energy source is the initial velocity of the system. For this reason, we add the arbitrary isobaric functions $\mathbf{P}$ and $P$ of weight zero,  which must themselves be smooth everywhere in $\rm I\!R^3$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
	\vec{u} & = & t^{\frac{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}{\alpha_t}} \mathbf{F} \left( \frac{x}{t^{\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_t}}},\frac{y}{t^{\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_t}}} ,\frac{z}{t^{\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_t}}}  \right) +  x^{\frac{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}{\alpha_x}} \mathbf{P} \left( \frac{y}{x},\frac{z}{x}  \right)  \nonumber \\
	p &=& t^{\frac{2(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)}{\alpha_t}} F \left( \frac{x}{t^{\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_t}}},\frac{y}{t^{\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_t}}} ,\frac{z}{t^{\frac{\alpha_x}{\alpha_t}}} \right) +   x^{\frac{2(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)}{\alpha_x}} P \left( \frac{y}{x},\frac{z}{x}  \right).
%	\label{gen-selfsimilarsol1}
\end{eqnarray*}

Regarding smoothness at $t=0$: $\mathbf{F}$ and $F$ must be smooth in $({\rm I\!R}^3 \times 0)$; however, they are isobaric and as such must be either isobaric polynomials, or the ratio of such polynomials (note that such polynomials cannot contain constant terms since they do not have isobaric weight). Suppose they are a ratio of isobaric polynomials; then their denominators must be nonzero at $t=0$. However, at $t=0$ their denominators must be isobaric polynomials of only $x,y,z$ which are always zero at least at the origin. This is a contradiction with the requirement of smoothness. Therefore, $\mathbf{F}$ and $F$ must be isobaric polynomials. However, it is impossible to build a smooth polynomial by using the arguments $x_i/t^{(\alpha_x/\alpha_t)}$; since multiplying or adding them always leads to discontinuities in either $\rm I\!R^3$ (esp. at the origin) or at $t=0$. Similarly, $\mathbf{F}$ and $F$ cannot be closed-form functions of the given arguments, since the arguments are discontinuous in $({\rm I\!R}^3 \times 0)$. Therefore, the only remaining option is that they are constants.

	Regarding the smoothness of $x^{\frac{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}{\alpha_x}} \mathbf{P}$ and $x^{\frac{2(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)}{\alpha_x}} P$: in order for them to be smooth in $\rm I\!R^3$ (as per the requirement of smoothness at $t=0$ which ensures meaningful initial energy), they must be isobaric polynomials. They cannot be ratios of polynomials, since their denominators will have roots at the origin, etc. They cannot be closed-form functions, since their Taylor series will be either isobaric but discontinuous at least at the origin, or not isobaric. Finally, it is evident that $(\alpha_x-\alpha_t)/\alpha_x >0$ is mandatory to ensure smoothness. $\square$
%\end{proof}
	%INSERT END _OF_PROOF HERE

Therefore, according to Lemma \ref{Lemma}, if the self-similar solution is to be smooth and nonzero at $t=0$, the following condition must be true:
\[
	\frac{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}{\alpha_t} > 0, 
\]
that is, the power index of $t$ must be positive; and it is the stronger requirement in comparison to the requirement of the power index of $x$ being positive. Lemma \ref{Lemma} leads to the following corollaries

\begin{cor}
	The power index of both $t$ and of $x$ in (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol1}) is positive if 
\begin{align*}
	& \alpha_x > \alpha_t \mbox{ and } \alpha_t > 0, \mbox{ thus } \alpha_x > 0; \mbox{  or} \nonumber\\
	& \alpha_x < \alpha_t \mbox{ and } \alpha_x < 0, \mbox{ thus } \alpha_t <0 .
\end{align*}
\label{cor1-Lemma}
\end{cor}

\begin{cor}
The power index of $x$ in (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol1}) is positive if
\begin{align*}
	& \alpha_x > \alpha_t \mbox{ and } \alpha_x > 0  \mbox{  or} \nonumber\\
	& \alpha_x < \alpha_t \mbox{ and } \alpha_x < 0.
\end{align*}
\label{cor2-Lemma}
\end{cor}

\underline{Regarding the existence of the solutions} (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol1}): we begin by assuming that the NSE has smooth initial solutions/boundary conditions, i.e. smooth in $({\rm I\!R}^3 \times 0)$; this is done to ensure the fluid has finite initial energy. We can also assume our chosen solutions are nonzero at $t=0$, because the initial velocity and pressure are the energy source of the system. 

 While the NSE admits the scaling transformation (\ref{EK-scaling}), suppose all NSE solutions that scale-transform according to (\ref{EK-scaling}) are discontinued at $t=0$. Such supposition would be incorrect (e.g., see the initial solution/boundary condition for the Taylor-Green vortex, eq.(12) in \cite{Tay37}). We will therefore suppose, that the NSE always has nonzero solutions, smooth in $({\rm I\!R}^3 \times 0)$; and based on the scaling symmetry of the NSE we will also assume that some of these solutions scale-transform according to (\ref{EK-scaling}). Then, they must be in the form (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol1}), according to Lemma \ref{Lemma}.

In the case $\alpha_t = 2\alpha_x$, the solutions are known to exist; these are Leray’s self-similar solutions. As stated in the sections below, Leray’s self-similar solutions are known in the literature and are accepted as solutions of the NSE based on their scaling symmetry/invariance. Analogously, this will be true for arbitrary $\alpha_t$ and $\alpha_x$, where the solutions (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol1}) exhibit scaling symmetry/invariance. Scale invariant solutions are native solutions to the NSE as they stem from its symmetry properties. For example, the initial solution/boundary condition for the Taylor-Green vortex, (eq.(12) in \cite{Tay37}) is a scale invariant solution for any $\alpha_t$ and $\alpha_x$; and so is the solution, eq. (21) in \cite{Tay37}. 
 

\underline{Regarding the criticality of the NSE problem}: it may be supercritical, critical or subcritical depending on how its conserved quantities scale when the solution is subjected to a scaling transformation \cite{Tao08}; suppose $X$ is a conserved quantity; then, if $\lambda$ is a scaling coefficient,

(a) the PDE is $X$-critical, if $X^\prime=X$ $\forall \lambda$ (scale-invariant);

(b) the PDE is $X$-subcritical, if $X^\prime$ diminishes as $\lambda$ increases ($\lambda > 1$);

(c) the PDE is $X$-supercritical, if $X^\prime$ increases as $\lambda$ increases ($\lambda > 1$).

\begin{thm}
	The self-similar solutions (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol}) of the NSE (\ref{NSE}) are smooth/regular in ${\rm I\!R}^3 \times [0, \infty)$ as long as they are energy-subcritical, smooth at $t=0$ and nonzero at $t=0$. 
\label{T2}
\end{thm}

%\begin{proof}
We begin by considering all self-similar solutions (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol}). To keep the NSE invariant under scaling transformation, the velocity and energy transform as
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\vec{u}^{\prime}&=&k^{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}\vec{u},  \nonumber \\
	E^{\prime}&=&k^{5\alpha_x-2\alpha_t}E.
%	\label{u-E}
\end{eqnarray*}
The energy $E$ at a given moment $t$, would be scale-invariant if $\vec{u}$ transformed according to the law 
\begin{equation*}
	\vec{u}^\prime=k^{-\frac{3}{2}\alpha_x}\vec{u}.
%	\label{u-E1}
\end{equation*}
Compare the transformations $k^{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}\vec{u}$ and $k^{-\frac{3}{2}\alpha_x}\vec{u}$; we have three cases to consider:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\alpha_x-\alpha_t &<& -\frac{3}{2} \alpha_x  \nonumber \\
	 \alpha_x-\alpha_t &>& -\frac{3}{2} \alpha_x  \nonumber \\
	 \alpha_x-\alpha_t &=& -\frac{3}{2} \alpha_x.
%	\label{cr-moduli}
\end{eqnarray*}
The three cases are compared whether they increase or decrease $u$ for small scales $k \rightarrow 0$. We arrive to a 5/2 law governing the criticality of the NSE:
\begin{align}
   & \frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_x} > \frac{5}{2}      \nonumber\\
	\mbox{subcritical, when  } &\alpha_x>\alpha_t, \alpha_x<0, \alpha_t<0, \nonumber\\
	\mbox{subcritical, when  } &\alpha_x<\alpha_t, \alpha_x>0, \alpha_t>0;
\label{5/2-1}	
\end{align}
\begin{align}
   & \frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_x} < \frac{5}{2}      \nonumber\\
	\mbox{supercritical, when  } &\alpha_x>\alpha_t, \alpha_x<0, \alpha_t<0, \nonumber\\
	\mbox{supercritical, when  } &\alpha_x<\alpha_t, \alpha_x>0, \alpha_t>0, \nonumber\\
	\mbox{supercritical, when  } &\alpha_x>\alpha_t, \alpha_x>0, \nonumber\\
	\mbox{subcritical, when  } &\alpha_x<\alpha_t, \alpha_x<0, \nonumber\\
	\mbox{subcritical, when  } &\alpha_x=\alpha_t;
\label{5/2-2}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
   & \frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_x} = \frac{5}{2}      \nonumber\\
	\mbox{critical, when  } &\alpha_x>\alpha_t, \alpha_x<0, \alpha_t<0, \nonumber\\
	\mbox{critical, when  } &\alpha_x<\alpha_t, \alpha_x>0, \alpha_t>0.
\label{5/2-3}
\end{align}
	The case $\alpha_x=1$, $\alpha_t=2$ yields $\alpha_t/\alpha_x=2 < 5/2$, supercritical. We omit the possible combinations that involve $\alpha_x=0$ since in them the $x,y,z$ coordinates do not rescale. Now we will limit our study only to those self-similar solutions that are not equivalent to zero and are smooth in $({\rm I\!R}^3 \times 0)$. Such solutions will have the form (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol1}); the corollaries of  Lemma \ref{Lemma} show the conditions that need to be met. 

\begin{prop}
	According to Corollary \ref{cor2-Lemma}, to have solutions smooth in $x$ we need $\alpha_x > \alpha_t, \alpha_x > 0$, irrespective of the sign of $\alpha_t$. This is a supercritical case by virtue of (\ref{5/2-2}). If $\alpha_t>0$, the solutions are smooth in $t$, according to Corollary \ref{cor1-Lemma}.  
\label{prop1}
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
	According to Corollary \ref{cor2-Lemma}, we may also have solutions smooth in $x$, as long as $\alpha_x < \alpha_t, \alpha_x < 0$, irrespective of the sign of $\alpha_t$. This is a subcritical case by virtue of (\ref{5/2-2}). If $\alpha_t<0$, the solutions are smooth in $t$, according to Corollary \ref{cor1-Lemma}.  
\label{prop2}
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
According to Corollary \ref{cor1-Lemma}, to have solutions smooth in both $t$ and $x$ we need $\alpha_x > \alpha_t, \alpha_t > 0, \alpha_x > 0$; this is a supercritical case by virtue of (\ref{5/2-2}), irrespective of the sign of $\alpha_t$.
\label{prop3}
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
According to Corollary \ref{cor1-Lemma}, we may also have solutions smooth in both $t$ and $x$, as long as $\alpha_x < \alpha_t, \alpha_t < 0, \alpha_x < 0$; this is a subcritical case by virtue of (\ref{5/2-2}).
\label{prop4}
\end{prop}
	Consider the solutions of Proposition \ref{prop4}; they are energy-subcritical and smooth in $({\rm I\!R}^3 \times [0,\infty))$. Suppose they are diverging at some time $t \in (0, T]$. According to the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion \cite{BKM},
\begin{align*}
	& \int_0^T \mbox{sup}|\nabla \times \vec{u}| dt = \infty; \nonumber \\
	& \Rightarrow \mbox{   } \exists t: |\nabla \times \vec{u}| = \infty; \nonumber \\
	& \Rightarrow \mbox{   } \exists i: \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial x_i} = \infty, \nonumber
\end{align*}
	where $i = 1,2,3$ and $x_1=x; x_2=y; x_3=z$. Suppose this is induced solely by rescaling, that is, a smooth solution of the NSE begins to diverge due to the scaling invariant properties of the equation, 
\begin{align*}
	 \left( \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial x_i} \right)^\prime = \frac{k^{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}}{k^{\alpha_x}} \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial x_i} = \nonumber \\
	= k^{-\alpha_t} \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial x_i} = \frac{1}{k^{\alpha_t}}  \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial x_i} = \infty, 
\end{align*}
where we take $(\partial \vec{u}/\partial x_i)^{\prime} = (\partial \vec{u^{\prime}}/\partial x^{\prime}_i)$. 
At fine scales, $k \rightarrow 0$ and therefore it must be true that 
\[
	\alpha_t >0, 
\]
which is a contradiction, since according to Proposition \ref{prop4}, our chosen solutions require $\alpha_t<0$. $\square$ 
%\end{proof}

Therefore, rescaling does not lead to the divergence of our chosen solutions. This can be shown even for the supercritical cases. Consider the supercritical cases of Propositions \ref{prop1}, \ref{prop3}. These solutions are discontinued at $t=0$, but are smooth everywhere else. The proof in Theorem \ref{T2} applies here as well (excluding the point $t=0$), since again $\alpha_t<0$. Because our chosen solutions are isobaric polynomials in $x,y,z$ and $t$, the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion confirmed that their smoothness in $({\rm I\!R}^3 \times [0,\infty))$ cannot lead to divergence through rescaling. 
Then, since the energy balance is given by \cite{Wie19}
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\frac{1}{2}\int _{\rm I\!R^3} |\vec{u}(x,y,z,t)|^2 dxdydz  + \nonumber \\ 
	 +\nu \int_0^t \int _{\rm I\!R^3} |\nabla \vec{u}(x,y,z,s)|^2 dxdydzds = \nonumber \\ 
	 =  \frac{1}{2}\int _{\rm I\!R^3} |\vec{u}(x,y,z,0)|^2 dxdydz,
	\label{ebalance}
\end{eqnarray*}
the total energy of the fluid will remain finite through energy conservation. We have assumed $\vec{u}_0 \in C^\infty ({\rm I\!R}^3)$ and expect both the Rhs and Lhs to be finite, as long as the energy is subcritical as per Theorem \ref{T2} which ensures that the velocity does not diverge anywhere in ${\rm I\!R^3}$ and for $\forall t$. To solidify this conclusion, we can add that it is straightforward to ensure that the solutions (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol1}) do not grow far from the origin or in time, since Lemma \ref{Lemma} admits for
\begin{equation*}
	t^{\frac{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}{\alpha_t}} \mbox{   and   } x^{\frac{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}{\alpha_x}} 
\end{equation*}
to be multiplied with arbitrary functions with zero isobaric weight $Z(t/T)$, e.g. $\exp[-(t/T)]$ and $\zeta(x/L_x,y/L_y,z/L_z)$, e.g. $\exp[-(x^2+y^2+z^2)/L^2]$, where $T,L_i$ are dimensional constants and $Z$, $\zeta$ can be closed-form functions that tend to zero at infinity  (alternatively, $Z$ and $\zeta$ can be oscillating functions).

\section{When Viscosity does not scale}

In this section, we will work with the scaling transformation (\ref{scaling}), where the viscosity $\nu$ is kept at the same value at all length scales. This is the case $\alpha_x=1$, $\alpha_t=2$ (or, $\alpha_t=2\alpha_x$) in (\ref{EK-scaling}). Bouton's theorem (\ref{T2-Bouton}) yields Leray's self-similar solutions \cite{Can96} \cite{Ler34}
\begin{eqnarray}
	\vec{u}(x,y,z,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} \mathbf{F}\left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{t}},\frac{y}{\sqrt{t}},\frac{z}{\sqrt{t}} \right) \nonumber \\
	p(x,y,z,t)= \frac{1}{t} F \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{t}},\frac{y}{\sqrt{t}},\frac{z}{\sqrt{t}} \right).
	\label{Leray}
\end{eqnarray}
In the literature, Jean Leray \cite{Ler34} is credited with noticing that due to its scaling invariance the NSE admits the so-called {\it self-similar} solutions \cite{Erc15} \cite{Brad18} $e^{\varepsilon} \vec{u}(e^{\varepsilon}(x,y,z),e^{2\varepsilon}t)$, $e^{2\varepsilon}p(e^{\varepsilon}(x,y,z),e^{2\varepsilon}t)$, where $\varepsilon \ge 0 $ \cite{Fus03}. According to Bouton's Theorem \ref{T2-Bouton} for the NSE, Leray's self-similar solutions are the only possible self-similar solutions which the scaling transformation (\ref{scaling}) can generate. They are undefined at $t=0$ or at the origin etc., resulting in divergence of the fluid energy at the initial moment or at the origin etc. Analogous reasoning applies to the general scaling transformation (\ref{EK-scaling}) with $\alpha_t=2\alpha_x$, where again the solutions have fluid energy undefined at $t=0$ or at the origin/along the axes.

Continuing our study of the case of non-scaling viscosity $\alpha_t=2\alpha_x$, we note that Theorem \ref{T2-Bouton} can be modified to take units, or dimensionalization, into account:
\begin{thm} (of Bouton): In the case $\alpha_t=2\alpha_x$, in order to meet all isobarity requirements of their scaling transformation, the relative invariant functions $u(x,y,z,t)$, $v(x,y,z,t)$ and $w(x,y,z,t)$ must be homogeneous in $x,y,z$ of degree 1 and homogeneous in $t$ of degree -1; while the relative invariant function $p(x,y,z,t)$  must be homogeneous in $x,y,z$ of degree 2 and homogeneous in $t$ of degree -2. The Navier-Stokes system of PDEs becomes: 
\begin{eqnarray}
	\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + (\vec{u} \cdot \nabla)\vec{u} &=& \nu  \Delta \vec{u} - \nabla p \nonumber\\
	\nabla \cdot \vec{u} &=& 0  \nonumber\\
	(\vec{r}\cdot\nabla)\vec{u}&=&\vec{u}  \nonumber\\
	 t\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t}&=& -  \vec{u} \nonumber\\
	(\vec{r}\cdot\nabla)p&=&2p \nonumber\\
	t\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} & = & -2p .
	\label{NSE2}	
\end{eqnarray}
\label{T3-Bouton}
\end{thm}

The added equations represent the conditions of homogeneity. They yield a set of solutions, which are a subset of Leray's self-similar solutions (\ref{Leray}):
\begin{eqnarray}
	\vec{u}(x,y,z,t) &=& \frac{x}{t} \mathbf{F}\left(\frac{y}{x},\frac{z}{x}\right)  \nonumber \\
	p(x,y,z,t)&=& \frac{x^2}{t^2} F\left(\frac{y}{x},\frac{z}{x}\right),
	\label{dim-sol}
\end{eqnarray}
where again the solutions have fluid energy undefined at $t=0$. The solutions (\ref{Leray}) and (\ref{dim-sol}) can be considered defined for $t>0$ and $t<0$ \cite{Brad18}. We note that the self-similar solutions (\ref{dim-sol}) of the PDE system (\ref{NSE2}) are in the form $\varphi(t)F(x,y,z)$ - the time dependence is a factor which multiplies a function of the spatial coordinates. (\ref{dim-sol}) can be considered to have proper units, if this is necessary for a study of the dimensionalized NSE. Through homogeneity, $u(x,y,z,t)$, $v(x,y,z,t)$, $w(x,y,z,t)$ are isobaric polynomials (or, ratios of such polynomials) of weight $W=-1$; while $p(x,y,z,t)$ is an isobaric polynomials/ratios of weight $W=-2$. Proper isobarity in both $x,y,z$ and $t$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for their correct transformation.  
 

\begin{thm}
	Within the set of Leray's self-similar solutions (\ref{Leray}), there is always a subset (\ref{dim-sol}) which is smooth in  ${\rm I\!R}^3 \times (0,\infty)$.
\label{T3}
\end{thm}
%\begin{proof}
According to \cite{Llo81}, the NSE admits the following Lie groups of transformations:

Time translations
\begin{eqnarray}
	\mathcal{T}&=&\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \nonumber \\
	t' &=& t + \tau;  \nonumber \\
	-\infty < \tau < \infty,& &  \tau=\mbox{const}
    \label{timetranslations}
\end{eqnarray}

Scale changes
\begin{eqnarray}
	\mathcal{X} = x \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + y \frac{\partial }{\partial y} + z \frac{\partial }{\partial z} + 2t \frac{\partial }{\partial t}- \nonumber\\ 
       - u \frac{\partial }{\partial u} - v \frac{\partial }{\partial v} - w \frac{\partial }{\partial w} - 2p \frac{\partial }{\partial p}
	\label{scaling-oper}	
\end{eqnarray}

Infinitesimal rotations

\begin{eqnarray}
	\mathcal{R}_x= y\frac{\partial}{\partial z}-z\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+v\frac{\partial}{\partial w}-w\frac{\partial}{\partial v}; \nonumber\\ 
	\mathcal{R}_y= z\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-x\frac{\partial}{\partial z}+w\frac{\partial}{\partial u}-u\frac{\partial}{\partial w}; \nonumber\\
	\mathcal{R}_z= x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}-y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+u\frac{\partial}{\partial v}-v\frac{\partial}{\partial u}. 
    \label{rotations}
\end{eqnarray}

Because the operators (\ref{timetranslations})-(\ref{rotations}) do not depend on partial derivatives, all absolute covariants of the NSE will depend only on $u,v,w,p$. This is a property of the NSE worth noticing; its importance will be seen in the last chapter of this work.

The necessary and sufficient condition the absolute invariants/covariants of the NSE must satisfy is expressed in the system of five PDEs
\begin{eqnarray}
      \mathcal{T}I = 0 \nonumber \\
      \mathcal{X}I = 0 \nonumber \\
      \mathcal{R}_x I = 0 \nonumber \\
      \mathcal{R}_y I = 0 \nonumber \\
      \mathcal{R}_z I = 0. 
      \label{0-form-system}
\end{eqnarray}
	We solve (\ref{0-form-system}) with Maple \cite{Map19} and obtain all absolute covariants
\begin{equation}
	I = F \left( \frac{p}{u^2+v^2+w^2} \right),
	\label{allcovariants}
\end{equation}
	where $F$ is an arbitrary function and $p/\rho$ is written shortly as ``$p$''. It needs to be noted, that the form of all covariants (\ref{allcovariants}) is valid under the transformation (\ref{EK-scaling}) as well as under the general scaling (\ref{EK-scaling}); in the first case we solve the PDE system (\ref{0-form-system}), while in the later $\mathcal{X}$ is replaced by  two scaling operators. In the simplest case the quantity (\ref{allcovariants}) equals the dimensionless Euler's number 
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{E} = \frac{p}{u^2+v^2+w^2},
	\label{Eu}
\end{equation}
also known as cavitation number (if the vapor pressure is set to zero). $\mathcal{E}$ is an invariant with respect to all symmetry transformations of the NSE (eqs. (\ref{0-form-system})). From (\ref{dim-sol}) it follows that due to the factorization of the self-similar solution, the time-dependent parts in $\mathcal{E}$ cancel out and it turns out to be a conserved quantity (in time),
\begin{eqnarray}
	\mathcal{E} =\frac{F_4}{F_1^2+F_2^2+F_3^2}=\mbox{const}.
	\label{Eu-const}
\end{eqnarray}
The cavitation number $\mathcal{E}$ contains the square of the modulus of the velocity $|\vec{u}|^2$ in denominator and can thus be considered coercive, or providing upper bounds to the size of the solution; it is not an integral over ${\rm I\!R^3}$ and thus not subject to delta-functions within the integration domain. Suppose that at large scales $k\gg1$ the modulus of the velocity is finite but the energy of the system cannot ensure it does not tend to infinity at a certain location at very fine scales. $\mathcal{E}$ is scale-invariant which means that as long as it has finite value at large scales it must retain them at arbitrarily fine scales as well. This would guarantee that $|\vec{u}|^2$ does not grow uncontrollably at any locale of infinitely small size. In addition, this control is being exercised at any given moment in time, because $\mathcal{E}$ is conserved, (\ref{Eu-const}). Also, $|\vec{u}|$ and the pressure $p$ cannot be diverging together as per the Bernoulli principle for incompressible fluids; and therefore, the ratio $p/|\vec{u}^2|$ cannot be finite unless both its numerator and denominator are finite $\forall t$. $\square$	
%\end{proof}
\begin{thm}
	When the viscosity is not allowed to scale, $\alpha_x=1$, $\alpha_t=2$ (or, $\alpha_t=2\alpha_x$), the Navier-Stokes equation (\ref{NSE}) has a set of non self-similar solutions, which are nonzero at $t=0$, nontrivial (not identically zero everywhere) and infinitely differentiable throughout ${\rm I\!R}^3$ and $\forall t$.
\label{T-nonselfsim}
\end{thm}

	According to Lemma \ref{Lemma}, The NSE exhibits self-similar solutions (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol1}) under the general scaling transformation (\ref{EK-scaling}) when the viscosity is allowed to scale. If the viscosity is not allowed to scale i. e.,  $\alpha_x=1$, $\alpha_t=2$ (or, $\alpha_t=2\alpha_x$), the solutions (\ref{gen-selfsimilarsol1})
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\vec{u} &=&\mathbf{C} t^{\frac{\beta_x-\beta_t}{\beta_t}} +  x^{\frac{\beta_x-\beta_t}{\beta_x}} \mathbf{P} \left( \frac{y}{x},\frac{z}{x}  \right)  \nonumber \\
	p &=& C t^{\frac{2(\beta_x-\beta_t)}{\beta_t}}  +  x^{\frac{2(\beta_x-\beta_t)}{\beta_x}} P \left( \frac{y}{x},\frac{z}{x}  \right), \nonumber \\
	 \beta_t &\ne & 2 \beta_x
%	\label{gen-selfsimilarsol2}
\end{eqnarray*}
	still exist (as per the discussion following Corollary \ref{cor2-Lemma}), however they do not transform according to 
\begin{eqnarray*}	
	(u',v',w')&=&(1/k)(u,v,w) \nonumber \\
	p'&=&(1/k^2)p,  \nonumber \\
	0<k<\infty,& &k=\mbox{const}, 
\end{eqnarray*}
	and are therefore non self-similar under this transformation. Consider the supercritical (under the general scaling transformation (\ref{EK-scaling}))  solutions of Proposition \ref{prop3}: here, $\beta_x>\beta_t$ and $\beta_x > 0$. We will set $\beta_t>0$, since its sign is irrelevant. Suppose that the solutions are smooth and then diverging after finite time. Suppose this is induced solely by rescaling, that is, a smooth solution of the NSE begins to diverge due to the scaling invariant properties of the equation. According to the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion, the integral of the vorticity will diverge and  since $\alpha_t=2\alpha_x$, it must be true that
\begin{equation*}
	\left( \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial x_i} \right)^\prime = k^{\beta_x-\beta_t}\frac{\left[k^{\frac{2}{\beta_t}}\mathbf{C}t+k^{\frac{1}{\beta_x}}x\mathbf{P}(\frac{y}{x},\frac{z}{x}) \right]}{\partial x_i} = \infty 
\end{equation*}
	at fine scales $k \rightarrow 0$, which would be possible as long as $\beta_x<\beta_t$, or $\beta_x < 0$ or $\beta_t<0$. However, any of these would contradict the supercriticality condition of Proposition \ref{prop3}. It is not possible therefore that this set of solutions would exhibit scaling induced blow-up in finite time. Moreover, since the non self-similar solutions of Bouton are nonzero at $t=0$ and nontrivial (not identically zero everywhere) as per Lemma \ref{Lemma}, by virtue of the same Lemma \ref{Lemma} they are polynomials, and therefore infinitely differentiable in ${\rm I\!R}^3 \times [0, \infty)$.   

\section{Turbulence}
We calculate the scaling invariants of the NSE in the case $\alpha_x=1, \alpha_t=2$ (transformation (\ref{scaling})), independently of other transformations by writing $\mathcal{X}I=0$, where the infinitesimal operator of scale changes $\mathcal{X}$ is given in (\ref{scaling-oper}). Maple yields 
\begin{equation*}
	I = F \left(\frac{y}{x},\frac{z}{x},ux,vx,wx,px^2,\frac{t}{x^2} \right), 
\end{equation*}
$F$ being an arbitrary function. Then $|\vec{u}|^2 r^2$ is an absolute covariant ($r = |\vec{r}\mbox{ }| = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$); so are $(\vec{u}\cdot\vec{r})^2$, $(\vec{r} \times \vec{u})_i$ and $(\vec{r} \times \vec{u})^2$ etc. Write $I$ as
\begin{equation}
	|\vec{r} \times \vec{u}| + \left(\frac{1}{\nu}\right) pr^2.
	\label{ang-mom-inv}
\end{equation}
This is a scale-invariant quantity in which $|\vec{r} \times \vec{u}|$ is the modulus of the angular momentum per unit mass for fluid at position $\vec{r}$; the pressure-viscosity term $(1/\nu) pr^2$ has the same units and can be considered to account for viscous transfer of angular momentum. Next, consider the total angular momentum of the fluid per unit mass:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\vec{H}_{\mbox{tot}}}{m_0} =\sum\limits_{\rm I\!R^3}  (\vec{r} \times \vec{u}) =\mbox{const}.
	\label{Htot}
\end{equation}
The RHS is scale-invariant vector because $X(\vec{r} \times \vec{u})_i=0$; then the total angular momentum per unit mass is a scale-invariant and a conserved quantity as well (recall that $m_0=\mbox{const}$ is the unit mass of the fluid particle at position $\vec{r}$ as fluid density is the same everywhere). 

It may be argued, that the above mentioned scale-invariants as well as eqs. (\ref{ang-mom-inv}) and (\ref{Htot}) suggest collective fluid behavior: the scaling invariance of $\vec{r} \times \vec{u}$ and $\vec{r} \cdot \vec{u}$ means that if at some scale $|\vec{u}|$ decreases yet at a different scale $|\vec{r} \times \vec{u}|$ will remain invariant if the angle between $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{u}$ changes ($|\vec{r} \times \vec{u}|=|\vec{r}||\vec{u}|\sin \gamma$). The invariant behavior of $\vec{r} \cdot \vec{u}$ suggests the same: the change of $|\vec{u}|$ at one scale may trigger changes of the direction of fluid motion at other scales ($\vec{r} \cdot \vec{u}=|\vec{r}||\vec{u}|\cos \gamma$). Small changes in $|\vec{u}|$ can set off large changes in the directions of motion at smaller scales. Nonetheless, such momentum exchanges between scales can only take place in different moments because time is scaled as well. 

However, (\ref{Htot}) represents a conserved quantity. Through scale invariance, any changes in $\vec{r} \times \vec{u}$ on a large scale will trigger instantaneous changes in the small scales, where rotation can take place. This is a collective behavior throughout the fluid volume, made possible by viscous transfer of momentum (i.e. the second term in (\ref{ang-mom-inv})) and ultimately due to the scaling invariance of the NSE.

Then, turbulence can generally be looked upon as the collective tendency of a viscous fluid to generate small scale vortices via its scaling properties and exchange of momentum. Such explanation is only qualitative though, while what is desired is a quantitative description which would allow control of turbulent phenomena. For this reason, in prior sections of this work we have analyzed the self-similar and non self-similar solutions of the NSE at all scales. Since non self-similar solutions exist and are smooth at arbitrary scales (Theorem \ref{T-nonselfsim}), they can be related to turbulence. Also, in the next section, the invariant analysis is extended further and additional scale-invariant properties are found, likely related to turbulence through their scaling properties and the cavitation number $\mathcal{E}$ present in them.



\section{Differential Forms as Conserved Quantities}

The invariant theory of Bouton-Lie \cite{Bou99} consists of deriving the invariants of a differential equation; this is accomplished by examining the finite transformations admitted by the equation as well as by putting to use their infinitesimal operators to find absolute and relative invariants; both approaches give the same results. In this section, we will limit our study to the scaling transformation (\ref{scaling}), where $\alpha_x=1,\alpha_t=2$, or $\alpha_t=2\alpha_x$, since it yields a conserved quanity, $\mathcal{E}$. Recall equation (\ref{0-form-system}): all transformations, admitted by the NSE were used together to form the system of five PDEs $\mathcal{T}I=0$, $\mathcal{X}I=0$,... in order to find a common covariant. As a matter of fact, the PDE system (\ref{0-form-system}) is equivalent to the system of Lie derivatives
\begin{eqnarray}
   \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}}\omega^n=0 \nonumber\\
   \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{X}}\omega^n=0 \nonumber\\
   \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{R}_x}\omega^n=0 \nonumber\\
   \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{R}_y}\omega^n=0 \nonumber\\
   \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{R}_z}\omega^n=0,
   \label{n-form}
\end{eqnarray}
where $I = \omega^0$ of eq.(\ref{0-form-system}) is a zero-form covariant (when $n=0$) along the flows of the vector fields $\mathcal{T},\mathcal{X},\mathcal{R}_x,\mathcal{R}_y,\mathcal{R}_z$. It makes sense to study precisely these flows, since they correspond to vector fields that leave the NSE unchanged. Therefore, Bouton's invariant analysis of the NSE is but a first stage from a total of nine stages, all of which yield invariants. The nine stages correspond to the 8 variables $x,y,z,t,u,v,w,p$ with whose differentials we can build 0-, 1-, ... and 8-forms. In all stages we use Maple to calculate the solutions of the corresponding systems of PDEs.

In all cases, we calculate (\ref{n-form}) seeking $n-$form covariants as expressions of the dependent variables $u,v,w,p$. Then we proceed as follows: we replace these variables with their corresponding functions, the solutions of the NSE $u(x,y,z,t),v(x,y,z,t),w(x,y,z,t)$ and $p(x,y,z,t)$. We then examine the resulting expressions and focus on those of them, which are conserved in time due to the cancelling out of the time-dependent factor. From Theorem \ref{T3-Bouton} it follows that they will also be scale-invariant. The fractions $p/\vec{u}^2$, $u/v$, $|\vec{u}|/v$, $\vec{u}^2/(uv)$ etc. are time-independent by virtue of (\ref{dim-sol}). This result follows from Theorem \ref{T3-Bouton}, according to which the self-similar solutions contain time as a factor and thus the above ratios represent dimensionless scalar fields that no longer depend on $t$. In all expressions, $\vec{u}^2=u^2+v^2+w^2$; $|\vec{u}|=\sqrt{u^2+v^2+w^2}$. 

The idea to utilize Cartan's calculus in the study of the NSE has been researched previously by R. Kiehn \cite{Kie03}, \cite{Kie01}. In his analysis, he has studied the Lie derivatives along the flows of vector fields and their application to the NSE while in this work, the focus is on the vector fields of the differential operators admitted by the NSE. The significance of the derived results below is subject to future research where it would be determined how the invariants of the NSE are related to the physics of the flow.

{\underline {\it 0-forms:}} To find the 0-forms that are covariants of all five operators simultaneously, we write eq. (\ref{0-form-system}). As explained, this is equivalent to the system of five Lie derivatives (\ref{n-form}) when $n=0$; it is a system of five PDEs, which yields the covariants (\ref{allcovariants}). In the simplest case, this is (\ref{Eu}), the Euler's, or, cavitation number $\mathcal{E}$. Thus, $B_0=\mathcal{E}$ is an absolute invariant 0-form of the NSE; time-independent by virtue of (\ref{dim-sol}) and thus a conserved quantity of Bouton $B_0$. It is a dimensionless scalar field in ${\rm I\!R}^3$; its name ``cavitation number'' indicates that $\mathcal{E}$ is related to cavitation phenomena and thus to turbulence. All conserved quiantities below are multiples of $\mathcal{E}$.

Recall again the fact that all infinitesimal operators in (\ref{timetranslations})-(\ref{rotations}) do not depend on the derivatives of $u,v,w,p$ as demonstrated by Lloyd \cite{Llo81}. This is an advantageous circumstance based on which all NSE invariants are expressions of the dependent variables alone. Because they do not contain derivatives, we can use them to find conserved quantities in a simple functional form.  

{\underline {\it 1-forms:}} Let $\omega^1$ be the form $\omega^1=a_1(u,v,w,p)dx+a_2(u,v,w,p)dy+...+a_8(u,v,w,p)dp$. We solve the system (\ref{n-form}) for $k=1$, which contains $8\times5 =40$ PDEs. No conserved quantities are found. All functions $a_i$ are considered to contain the dependent variables $u,v,w,p$. 

{\underline {\it 2-forms:}} Let $\omega^2$ be the form $\omega^2=a_1(u,v,w,p)dx \wedge dy+a_2(u,v,w,p)dx \wedge dz + ...+a_{28}(u,v,w,p)dw \wedge dp$. The form can be reduced to 28 terms. We solve the system (\ref{n-form}) for $k=2$, which contains $28\times5 =140$ PDEs. We obtain a 2-form conserved quantity $B_2$, which has 10 terms. All are multiplied by $F(B_0)$, where $F$ is an arbitrary function. For simplicity, we set $F(B_0) = B_0=\mathcal{E}$ and get

\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray*}
	B_2 = \mathcal{E} \Bigl[ \left(\frac{\vec{u}^2+u^2}{\vec{u}^2} \right) dx \wedge du + \Bigr. 
	                  \left(\frac{\vec{u}^2w+u|\vec{u}|v}{\vec{u}^2|\vec{u}|} \right) dx \wedge dv + 
			  \left(\frac{u|\vec{u}|w-v\vec{u}^2}{\vec{u}^2|\vec{u}|} \right) dx \wedge dw + \\
                  	+ \left(\frac{u|\vec{u}|v-w\vec{u}^2}{\vec{u}^2|\vec{u}|} \right) dy \wedge du +
	                  \left(\frac{\vec{u}^2+v^2}{\vec{u}^2} \right) dy \wedge dv + 
			  \left(\frac{|\vec{u}|v^3+u\vec{u}^2w}{\vec{u}^2|\vec{u}|w} \right) dy \wedge dw + \\
	                + \left(\frac{u|\vec{u}|w-v\vec{u}^2}{\vec{u}^2|\vec{u}|} \right) dz \wedge du + 
			  \left(\frac{|\vec{u}|vw-u\vec{u}^2}{\vec{u}^2|\vec{u}|} \right) dz \wedge dv + 
			  \left(\frac{\vec{u}^2+w^2}{\vec{u}^2} \right) dz \wedge dw + \\
			+ \Bigl. dt \wedge dp \mbox{ } \Bigr].
\end{eqnarray*}

\section{Conclusions}

We used the invariant theory of Bouton-Lie together with the general scaling transformation of the NSE to find the general form of all self-similar solutions for the velocity and pressure fields. Under this transformation, the NSE problem is no longer supercritical, but it can also be critical or subcritical. The criticality limit is governed by a 5/2 law, determined by the ratio of two of the scaling transformation parameters. A subset of Bouton's self-similar solutions are shown to have global in-time regularity by using the Beale-Kato-Majda argument. It is assumed that such solutions always exist due to the scaling properties of the NSE and the basic physics of the flow. 

We also studied Leray's self-similar solutions as well as the regularity of a subset of those: when the solutions are homogeneous functions, they yield a number of scale-invariant conserved quantities, which are differential forms of various order and likely related to the physics of turbulence. The functional form of all invariants and solutions were calculated with the symbolic package Maple, a well-established symbolic algebra package; its solutions are correct, and this is seen in their scale-invariant form. However, the solutions, although being part of the results of this work, are not the main result, but rather a secondary result which justified the use of Maple. The main results of the work are: (i) that Bouton’s method can be applied to any DE exhibiting scaling invariance; (ii) that Bouton’s method adds new PDEs to the Navier-Stokes system of equations for finding the symmetry solutions; (iii) that the relative scale-invariant solutions, as defined by Bouton are isobaric polynomials and thus infinitely differentiable; (iv) and most importantly, that when viscosity is kept fixed at all scales, the NSE always has non self-similar, isobaric polynomial solutions that are infinitely differentiable, nonzero at the initial moment, decreasing far from the origin and non increasing in time, as well as not diverging along the axes and at the origin.
